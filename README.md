# Cthulhu! (just wants a hug)
An infinite runner where you play as Cthulhu! who feels a tad lonely upon waking from his eternal slumber, and so crawls out of the cold, clammy, depths of the dark, foreboding, sea, and ventures onto land in search of somebody to hug. Unfortunately, the only people around seem to be all heading off in some massive hurry, so you must help Cthulhu to catch up to these scuttling mortals, get your hug, and maybe see what all this fuss is about.

## Aims
* Build an infinite runner in Unity
* Learn Unity from a test-driven development standpoint
* Document everything, so maybe it'll help somebody else
* Release on Android, and maybe iOS, PC, Mac, and Linux
